The objective of this project is to create a miniblog web app. 

The app allows one user to login, logout, post status. 

This app is packaged by setuptools to allow for the installation in the local client's machine. 

How to use it
      1. edit the configuration (config) in the flaskr.py file or
         export an FLASKR_SETTINGS environment variable
         pointing to a configuration file.

      2. install the app from the root (i.e. first miniblog folder) of the project directory

         bash: pbip install --editable .

      3. Instruct flask to use the right application

         export FLASK_APP=miniblog
	 export FLASK_DEBUG=true

      4. initialize the database with this command:

         flask initdb

      5. now you can run flaskr:

         flask run

         the application will greet you on
         http://localhost:5000/
